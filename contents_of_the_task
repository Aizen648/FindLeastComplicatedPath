A game round consists of sending a bird to fly over the checkerboard. When the bird approaches all Pointees
panic and jump to a random adjacent square. Pointees sitting on an edge square won't jump off the
checkerboard. The coupon remains on the square. At the end of each round the value of each coupon is
determined by the number of Pointees sitting on it. For example, if 4 Pointees are sitting on Coupon A from the
first square (row 1, column 1), then Coupon A is worth 4 points when the customer redeems it.

The customer can redeem a coupon with its points only after the 25th, 50th and 100th round. Please calculate
for each of these scenarios

- the number of points per each coupon
- the coupon(s) with the highest number of points.
